# Cahn-Hilliard-Project
Project involving simulating Cahn Hilliard PDE in one and two dimensions with Matlab and Python w/FORTRAN modules

The math is outlined in pde_project.pdf

The rest of the files are used for calculating solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation using either an explicit finite difference method or a semi-implicit method (see pdf for details)

Additionally, the source code for everything used is also included in the appendix of the PDF, so really glancing through the pdf is most useful thing to do if you are interested in any of this
